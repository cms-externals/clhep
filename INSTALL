#  building CLHEP
#-------------------------------------------------------------

You may build CLHEP as a complete package, starting from this 
top level directory, or you may build any package separately.

Cmake is now the preferred build option.
Building with autotools and configure is deprecated.
Although it may be possible to build with autotools, 
we strongly recommend building with cmake. 
You MUST use cmake when building with clang and other exotic compilers.

Please see either INSTALL.cmake or INSTALL.autotools for directions.

# about linking
#-------------------------------------------------------------

CLHEP builds libraries for each package in addition to a single CLHEP library.
This alllows you to link with only the necessary parts of CLHEP.
We provide a set of <package>-config scripts which gives the list of 
libraries to link, in the correct order.  
The script can be embedded in a makefile.

   clhep-config --libs       -  link list of ALL CLHEP libraries
   <package>-config --libs   -  link list of ONLY those libraries 
                                needed to use <package>
