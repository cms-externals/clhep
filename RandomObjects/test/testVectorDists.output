Test of RandMultiGauss distribution 

Please enter an integer seed:        How many vectors should we generate: Enter the dimensions of mu, then S (normally the same):  Enter mu, one component at a time: 
1: 2: 3: 4: 5: Enter S, one white-space-separated row at a time. 
The length needed for each row is given in {braces}.
The diagonal elements of S will be the first numbers on each line:
1 {5 numbers}: 2 {4 numbers}: 3 {3 numbers}: 4 {2 numbers}: 5 {1 numbers}: mu is: 

         -200
         -100
            0

Normal operation will try a single group of 20000 random vectors.
Enter 1 for a single trial with 20000 random vectors.
Alternatively some number of groups of 20000 vectors can be produced to accumulate deviation statistics.
Enter 167 or some other number of trials to do this:

Differences between each element and its normative value,
scaled by the expected deviation (sqrt(variance)) are: 

    -0.759194      0.929145       1.98349      0.781415      0.695964

About 5% of the above values should have absolute value more than 2.
Deviations of more than 4 sigma would probably indicate a problem.
The worst deviation of any element of D in this trial was 2.00585
