We may also want to have to add method like IsIgnored() and GetHandler()
so that you can set a temporary control behavior and then return to the
previous behavior.

It has been mentioned that the definitions on the subclasses supersede
(spelling ?) the behavior defined for the top class.  We may want to provide a
way to
over-ride this behavior so that one is easily able to ignore all the exceptions
types no matter what was set before.

The message seems redundant since the exception x already contain a message.
