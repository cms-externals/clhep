Exceptions Package Release Notes
--------------------------------

(NON-Release) Beta version	21-Nov-1997		W E Brown

This version of the Exceptions package is incorporated into pre-released
versions of ZOOM packages including HepTuple, and is tested on the supported 
platforms.  The exceptions will, by default, log in a sensible way.

Users obtaining ZOOM packages that may ZMthrow exceptions should be able to
do all the necessary activities:  Setting handlers and loggers, catching
exceptions ultimately thrown rather than ignored, and so forth.

Formal release is delayed until documentation supporting user-defined
ZOOM exceptions is prepared, and until the HepTuple package ZMexception
instrumentation is tested.
